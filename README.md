## **DESIGN**

### **Colors**
- Color scheme inspiration was taken from the various shades of green and blue found in the ocean. These colors are not only the developer's favorites but also have a calming effect that was desired to convey to the visitors. 
- A complementary color was added for sharp contrast. Color was taken from the pink corals featured in the background image of the "Home" page. This color is used throughout the page to create a sense of continuity, but with varying opacity depending on where it is used. White was chosen for all text to create a clear contrast against the darker turquoise background as it's the main color of the site. 
- These design choices was thought to help create a visually appealing and cohesive website that will leave a positive impression on our visitors.

### **Fonts**

- Logo /h1: Bruno Ace SC (capital letters)
- Rest of the headings: Bruno Ace (lower case letters)
- Font set to the body of the page (and therefore also as a fallback font to the headings): Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif.

The font used for headings had a design to it that really felt like it could fit this dive shop. 

### **Structure**
The site has been designed with a user-friendly and intuitive structure. Upon arrival, the user is greeted with a navigation bar that features the logo on the left and links to different sections of the website on the right.

The website is composed of four distinct pages:

- The homepage, which features sections information about the shop, contact form, opening hours, contact information and a map of location.
- An Courses page, which provides information about the courses the dive shop teaches. 
- The Dive Sites page, which showcases the different dive sites, what it costs and boat departures.
- A Gallery page, which features images that provide a glimpse of the experience of diving there.

By organizing the content into distinct pages, the website makes it easy for users to navigate and find the information they are looking for. Additionally, the use of a consistent navigation bar and footer throughout the website ensures that users can always find their way back to the main sections of the website and find the social media links.
