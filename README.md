# **Indo Diving Collective**

Welcome to the Indo Diving Collective, a dive shop website created out of our love for diving and desire to share it with others. The purpose is to provide a responsive and user-friendly experience that welcomes and intrigues users to visit the dive shop in the Gili Islands in Indonesia. Planning a dive trip can be overwhelming, so the website is designed with the user in mind to make the process as easy and enjoyable as possible. The site is easy to navigate and the design visually engaging to make sure it invites customers to explore the content and learn more about the dive shop and what it offers.

&nbsp;

## **DESIGN**

### **Colors**
- Color scheme inspiration was taken from the various shades of green and blue found in the ocean. These colors are not only the developer's favorites but also have a calming effect that was desired to convey to the visitors. 
- A complementary color was added for sharp contrast. Color was taken from the pink corals featured in the background image of the "Home" page. This color is used throughout the page to create a sense of continuity, but with varying opacity depending on where it is used. White was chosen for all text to create a clear contrast against the darker turquoise background as it's the main color of the site. 
- These design choices was thought to help create a visually appealing and cohesive website that will leave a positive impression on our visitors.

![](/docs/screenshots/screenshot_color_scheme.png)

### **Fonts**

- Logo /h1: Bruno Ace SC (capital letters)
- Rest of the headings: Bruno Ace (lower case letters)
- Font set to the body of the page (and therefore also as a fallback font to the headings): Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif.

The font used for headings had a design to it that really felt like it could fit this dive shop. 

### **Structure**
The site has been designed with a user-friendly and intuitive structure. Upon arrival, the user is greeted with a navigation bar that features the logo on the left and links to different sections of the website on the right.

The website is composed of four distinct pages:

- The homepage, which features sections information about the shop, contact form, opening hours, contact information and a map of location.
- An Courses page, which provides information about the courses the dive shop teaches. 
- The Dive Sites page, which showcases the different dive sites, what it costs and boat departures.
- A Gallery page, which features images that provide a glimpse of the experience of diving there.

By organizing the content into distinct pages, the website makes it easy for users to navigate and find the information they are looking for. Additionally, the use of a consistent navigation bar and footer throughout the website ensures that users can always find their way back to the main sections of the website and find the social media links.

## **Bugs**

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Got a double border bottom underline when link in nav bar was active.| Changed the targeted #id from "#menu" to "#menu li" |
| The hero image wouldn't get fixed in right size for the screen | Added the element style of "display: cover" for the image |
| Had much problems with aligning all the "divs" in the banner section properly | Learned about "flex"-boxes. Used "display:flex" and tested in Chrome Dev Tools to get it right. |
|The "Contact Us" link in nav bar would't link to contact form| Added href="index.html#contact" to link and an id="contact" to the form element.|
|Got an unwanted re-size-handle in the bottom corner of the textarea-container that messed up its fit for screen.| Added property "resize:none" in css to the textarea |
|The textarea-container would still be a bit misplaced after re-size handle issue got solved. | Enclosed textarea in a div id="textarea-wrapper" and set "text-align:center". |
| Tested and sent in a filled contact form with success, but saw that the text was hugging the textarea border. | Added 10px padding inside the textarea. |
| Couldn't get a hoover effect over the "Contact Us Today" buttons in "Dive Sites" + "Courses" because of the styled gradient color that made them look more "3D" | **No fix!** Chose to keep the better visually looking styling in this case. Only found solutions including other languages used to solve problem.
