# **Indo Diving Collective**

Welcome to the Indo Diving Collective, a dive shop website created out of our love for diving and desire to share it with others. The purpose is to provide a responsive and user-friendly experience that welcomes and intrigues users to visit the dive shop in the Gili Islands in Indonesia. Planning a dive trip can be overwhelming, so the website is designed with the user in mind to make the process as easy and enjoyable as possible. The site is easy to navigate and the design visually engaging to make sure it invites customers to explore the content and learn more about the dive shop and what it offers.
